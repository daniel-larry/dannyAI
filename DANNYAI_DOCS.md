## 🧠 1. Introduction

Hi! I’m **Daniel Larry**, and this document outlines my midterm project: **DannyAI – The Learning Assistant Companion**.

The goal of this project was to explore how modern web technologies can create a highly engaging and personalized AI learning assistant. Unlike a basic chatbot, **DannyAI** focuses on user experience, accessibility, and customization — all centered around an animated AI companion.

💡 The core idea: Build a **friendly learning assistant** that users can interact with, configure, and personalize to suit their style and learning habits.

## 🚀 2. Core Features

DannyAI is a feature-rich frontend application with several interactive components:

### 🎭 Animated Assistant

A vibrant animated character (or "orb") acts as the face of the AI, providing visual feedback and personality.

### 🙋 User Personalization

First-time users are prompted to enter their name and choose an avatar. This helps create a familiar, welcoming experience tailored to the individual.

### ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

A sidebar settings panel allows users to manage the application:

* **👤 Profile Settings**: Change name and avatar anytime.
* **♿ Accessibility Options**: Switch themes, adjust fonts, and toggle accessibility features.

### 📱 Modern, Responsive UI

Fully responsive design, optimized for both mobile and desktop, with a sleek, minimalist interface.

### 🧩 Component-Based Architecture

The application is built using reusable components — clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## 🛠️ 3. Technologies & Frameworks

To deliver performance and scalability, I adopted a modern, TypeScript-first tech stack:

* **⚛️ React.js** – Core UI library enabling reactive, component-based structure
* **🔷 TypeScript** – Static typing for cleaner, error-free code
* **⚡ Vite** – Super-fast dev server and optimized builds
* **🎨 Styling**:

  * `Tailwind CSS` – Utility-first styling framework
  * `PostCSS` – CSS transformation
* **📦 UI Components**:

  * `shadcn/ui` – Radix + Tailwind powered component library
* **🧹 ESLint** – Code linting and style consistency
* **📁 Package Managers**:

  * Support for `pnpm`, `npm`, and `bun` for developer flexibility

## 🔮 4. Future Development Plans

The current version lays the groundwork for a fully intelligent AI assistant. Here’s what’s next:

* **🧠 Backend AI Integration**: Connect to an actual LLM (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) for real-time conversations
* **🗨️ Conversation History**: Save chat logs and context across sessions
* **🧬 Contextual Memory**: Let the assistant remember facts, preferences, and topics
* **💾 Database Integration**: Use Firebase/Supabase to persist user data and interactions
* **🌀 Dynamic Animations**: Animate the assistant to reflect emotional or conversational states
* **🎨 Avatar & Theme Customization**: Broaden user control over appearance and layout
* **🚀 Deployment**: Host on **Vercel** or **Netlify** for public access

## ✅ 5. Conclusion

**DannyAI** is more than a school project — it's a glimpse into the future of **personalized education** powered by AI.

This journey has deepened my understanding of modern frontend practices, accessibility, and user experience design. While currently a frontend prototype, **DannyAI** has the potential to become a truly transformative learning companion.
