  ##  1. Introduction

  Hi! I’m **Daniel Larry**, and this document outlines my midterm project: **DannyAI – The Learning Assistant       
  Companion**.

  The goal of this project was to explore how modern web technologies can create a highly engaging and personalized 
  AI learning assistant. Unlike a basic chatbot, **DannyAI** focuses on user experience, accessibility, and 
  customization — all centered around an animated AI companion.

   The core idea: Build a **friendly learning assistant** that users can interact with, configure, and personalize 
  to suit their style and learning habits.

  ##  2. Core Features

  DannyAI is a feature-rich frontend application with several interactive components:

  ###  Animated Assistant

  A vibrant animated character (or "orb") acts as the face of the AI, providing visual feedback and personality.

  ###  User Personalization

  First-time users are prompted to enter their name and choose an avatar. This helps crve UI

  Fully responsive design, optimized for both mobile and desktop, with a sleek, minimalist interface.

  ###  Component-Based Architecture

  The application is built using reusable components — clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

  ## ️ 3. Technologies & Frameworks

  To deliver performance and scalability, I adopted a modern, TypeScript-first tech stack:

  * **⚛️ React.js** – Core UI library enabling reactive, component-based structure
  * ** TypeScript** – Static typing for cleaner, error-free code
  * **⚡ Vite** – Super-fast dev server and optimized builds
  * ** Styling**:

    * `Tailwind CSS` – Utility-first styling framework
    * `PostCSS` – CSS transformation
  * ** UI Components**:

    * `shadcn/ui` – Radix + Tailwind powered component library
  * ** ESLint** – Code linting and style consistency
  * ** Package Managers**:

    * Support for `pnpm`, `npm`, and `bun` for developer flexibility

  ##  4. Future Development Plans

  The current version lays the groundwork for a fully intelligent AI assistant. Here’s what’s next:

  * ** Backend AI Integration**: Connect to an actual LLM (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI) for real-time conversations
  * **️ Conversation History**: Save chat logs and context across sessions
  * ** Contextual Memory**: Let the assistant remember facts, preferences, and topics
  * ** Database Integration**: Use Firebase/Supabase to persist user data and interactions
  * ** Dynamic Animations**: Animate the assistant to reflect emotional or conversational states
  * ** Avatar & Theme Customization**: Broaden user control over appearance and layout
  * ** Deployment**: Host on **Vercel** or **Netlify** for public access

  ## ✅ 5. Conclusion

  **DannyAI** is more than a school project — it's a glimpse into the future of **personalized education** powered 
  by AI.

  This journey has deepened my understanding of modern frontend practices, accessibility, and user experience 
  design. While currently a frontend prototype, **DannyAI** has the potential to become a truly transformative 
  learning companion.
